Application Engineering
[Web Application Engineering]

Building for Users
Talk about the variety of users from grandma to 8 years old. Give some examples about their different backgrounds, behaviors culture

Beauty is in the Eye for Detail
Anyone can spot issues and judge them. Give some examples of inconsistencies and performance.

Unpredictability causes Engineering Complexity

Screen Sizes
Touch Gestures
Network - Bandwidth & Latency
Device Performance
Caching
Data Variability
Users & Accessibility

How Browsers Work - Basic Primitives

Download the code - html, css, js
Cookies & Headers
Run the code in a sandbox (safe and secure) - CORS, CSRF, XSS
DOM Tree
Single Threaded javascript for DOM manipulation
XMLHttpRequest for Fetching data from Server
Layout and Paint
Re-layout & Repaint
Event Bubbling

Every framework ultimately compiles into these primitives

How Browsers Work - Advanced

Local storage
Index DB
Service Workers
PWA
WebRTC
Video & Audio
WASM
WebGL

AI & UI

AI is really good at seeing and generating react code but inconsistently
Inconsistency gets noticed more in UI - achieving consistency is hard
Build systems and force AI to follow them
Write tests and run in agentic development loops
Give eyes to the AI

Takeaway

Building great applications is hard - poor quality is noticed and judged immediately
Understand user interaction principles to be a great application engineer
Upfront engineering with AI to build consistent experiences
